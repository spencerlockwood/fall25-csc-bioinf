I used ChatGPT (https://chat.openai.com/) to translate the report.pdf in Zhongyu Chenâ€™s genome-assembly repository from mandarin to english.


I predominantly used Claude Sonnet 4 (https://claude.ai/) to convert the python genome-assembly to Codon. I used it predominantly as a mentor into guide me through the process. Some examples of prompts I used to complete, especially that in abg.py, are as follows.

After feeding claude the three pipeline files (main.py, dbg.py, and utils.py) and the documentation linke for Codon (https://docs.exaloop.io/language/overview/), I wrote the following.

"give me a general outline Python script for how to convert the python pipeline I have attached into Codon"

This gave me a script outline I was able to work through. This, along with the codon documentation, allowed me to successfully convert this pipeline from Python to Codon.

Other than this, I did not need too much AI tools or any sort of LLM to complete this deliverable. It was quite straight foreward.
